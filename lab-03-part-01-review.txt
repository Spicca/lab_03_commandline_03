$ rm -rf [name of directory/folder]

for example:

$ rm -rf mtec1003-labs-02

(skip if these directories don't exist)
----------



==========
6.  A compressed archive (.tar.gz) of the lab files can be found at this url: 

http://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Wilson-MTEC1003/labs/03/mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz

Download this file to your home directory into a file called mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz.   Use a command that we learned to do this.

This command should have a *flag* to specify the output file.  MAKE SURE TO NAME YOUR OUTPUT FILE: mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz

Write the command(s) that you used to download this file - as well as its output - below:
----------
 curl -o mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz  https://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Wilson-MTEC1003/labs/03/mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

==========
7.  Uncompress the file that you just downloaded.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:
----------

 gzip mtec1003-lab-03.tar

 mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz already exists -- do you wish to overwrite (y or n)? y

==========
8.  You should now have a directory called mtec1003-lab-03 in your home directory.  Verify that this directory exists.

If the directory does not exist:

a. go to your home folder
b. go back to step 6

Otherwise...

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:

==========
10.  Now... go back home.  Then change to the science-fiction directory using a relative path.  The directory is located in books... which is located in the mtec1003-lab-03 directory.  Verify you're in the right directory using pwd.
